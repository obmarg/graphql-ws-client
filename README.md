# Overview

The goal of this library is to provide a runtime agnostic implementation for [GraphQL-over-Websocket](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/HEAD/PROTOCOL.md).
This is typically used for subscriptions but it can also be used for queries and mutations if you wish. The library is built upon the websocket library [async-tungstenite](https://github.com/sdroege/async-tungstenite).

## Integrations

The library offers integrations with some popular GraphQL clients with feature flags:

- [graphql-client](https://github.com/graphql-rust/graphql-client): `features = ["client-graphql-client"]`
- [cynic](https://github.com/obmarg/cynic): `features = ["client-cynic"]`

## Documentation

The documentation is quite limited at the moment, here are some sources:

1. The provided [examples](https://github.com/obmarg/graphql-ws-client/tree/master/examples/examples)
2. The reference documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/graphql-ws-client/)

## Logging

By default, the library will log some messages at the `trace` level to help you debug.
It is possible to turn off the logging entirely by using the `no-logging` feature.
